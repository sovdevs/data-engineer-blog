# rpraces project

A brief description of the project


## Initial Findings
How do we predict winners for any race?
Initial results are in based on the last 2,546 races this month (recency bias).

So far only formscore_rank and rpr_rabk come close to beating the baseline (bet the favorite/joint favorite).
OFRank and below are much further back and unlikely to be useful in the eventual multi-attribute selections.

NB Return is based on a uniform 1 unit bet. obviously not going to work as a 1 tuple attribute bet.

In terms of return, rank_lefthandedwinrate brings a positive return which suggests a possible angle of further inquiry.
Wrong Way Round is often overlooked by the market.

NB small size sample and no filtering yet for other variables such as field size, class, etc, which will come later with more data.

üîπ Approximate Sample Size (Races)
Small effects & high confidence (95%) ‚Üí 2,000+ races
Moderate effects & reasonable confidence (90%) ‚Üí 1,000 races
Larger effects & exploratory analysis (80%) ‚Üí 500 races

So at around 00 races over 6 days, we are a long way off from anything meaningful.
